Travis Watcher is a toolbar app for OSX that notifies you about your Travis builds.

## Installation

To install the app, download it from the [downloads page][downloads] on GitHub. Make sure you download the latest
version under "Downloads Packages", and not the "Download as zip" button.

[downloads]: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-watcher-macosx/downloads

## Preferences

![Preferences panel][preferences-panel]

If you click the Travis Icon in your toolbar (![Travis Icon][travis-icon]), you can open the preferences panel. There
you can enable the firehose, which will give you every single build notification on Travis. If this is too much for you,
you can enable specific repositories or users. If you want to, say, enable all build notifications for the travis-ci
organisation, you can add `travis-ci/*` to the list of repositories.

install` to download the dependencies.
